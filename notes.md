Things to do to Anonymize data 

- [ ] Identify where to make change in sync_columns_incremental & ups_merge 
- [ ] Create a macro that takes column name  and retun sql as needed for the column 
- [ ] Test that in simple sql 



In  sync_columns_incremental

```sql
{% do adapter.expand_target_column_types(
           from_relation=tmp_relation,
           to_relation=target_relation) %}
    {% set dest_columns = adapter.get_columns_in_relation(target_relation) %}
   --- add macrro here to replace the logic  
    {% if row_hash is none %}
        {% set build_sql = dbt_snowflake_get_incremental_sql(strategy, tmp_relation, target_relation, unique_key, dest_columns) %}
    {% else %}
        {% set build_sql = hash_merge_sql(tmp_relation, target_relation, unique_key, dest_columns) %}
    {% endif %}
  {% endif %}
```

    {% endif %}
    {{ return(meta_dict) }}

  
{% endmacro %}
```

      left join (
        select distinct letter, chr(97 + floor(random() * 26)::int) as value
        from unnest(generate_series(1, 26)) with ordinality as letters(idx, letter)
      ) as characters on letters.letter = characters.letter
    )
  end
{% endmacro %}
```



The SQL generated by the DBT model using the anonymize_string macro will depend on the database that you're using. Since you mentioned Snowflake, here's an example of what the SQL might look like when using Snowflake as the database:

Assuming that you have a table called my_table with columns email, name, address, and phone_number, and you want to anonymize the email column using the anonymize_string macro, the resulting SQL might look like this:

```sql
Copy code
select
  case
    when email is null then null
    else (
      select string_agg(characters.value, '' order by charindex)
      from unnest(regexp_split_to_array(email, '')) with ordinality as letters(letter, charindex)
      left join (
        select distinct letter, chr(97 + floor(random() * 26)::int) as value
        from unnest(generate_series(1, 26)) with ordinality as letters(idx, letter)
      ) as characters on letters.letter = characters.letter
    )
  end as anonymized_email,
  name,
  address,
  phone_number
from my_table

```

This SQL code is the result of the DBT model that calls the anonymize_string macro. It will generate a new column called anonymized_email that contains the anonymized version of the email column using the anonymize_string macro. The other columns (name, address, and phone_number) are preserved as-is.

The SQL code generated by DBT will vary depending on the specifics of your DBT model, but it will always be based on the DBT macro and model definitions that you've provided.

can buy data for security master ?
As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to sell data or offer any financial products or services. However, there are many companies that offer security master data for sale or subscription. These companies provide comprehensive data sets containing detailed information about securities, including their names, ticker symbols, prices, market capitalization, and other relevant data. Some popular providers of security master data include Bloomberg, Refinitiv (formerly Thomson Reuters), and FactSet. These companies offer data sets tailored to specific industries, asset classes, or geographic regions, and they may also offer tools and analytics to help users make sense of the data. It's important to carefully evaluate any data provider before making a purchase to ensure that the data is accurate, up-to-date, and relevant to your specific needs.




# Notes HUB

## Dave 

- PIMCO is looking to outsource and reduce focus on back-office operations
- The goal is to move current IMS State Street technology to the hub as a post-execution platform
- The hub is a post-execution platform, dealing with the allocation of trades to investment vehicles
-T he starting point of hub is post-execution, where trades are already executed and allocated to an investment vehicle
- Hub is designed to solve for functions such as cash positions, custody racks, and computing good NAV
- The system was built at BlackRock and a systematic hedge fund
-T he ultimate goal is to have a cohesive system that adds value to the front office
- The high-level view is meant to detail what problems the hub is trying to solve, and how it all comes together



The conversation revolves around a platform being built on the cloud with the main goal of creating a temporal immutable view to simplify data processes in the post-execution space. The platform is entirely streaming-based, event-based, and uses transaction capture to generate transactions to help solve the problem of data inconsistencies at the source. The platform is also designed to auto-generate P&L and client reporting data, replacing manual processes. The conversation ends with a discussion about what the platform team could do to make the project easier to work on, with the speaker emphasizing the importance of continuing to provide guidance on cloud and platform expertise.



- Hub is exploring the use of blockchain technology, but it doesn't necessarily solve the problem any differently than the current system.
- One area where blockchain could be useful is in the reconciliation space, where ledgers are built and transactions are generated.
- There is also interest in the digital ledger space, where shared libraries could generate transactions and eliminate the need for reconciliation, but this would require widespread adoption and may not be feasible for OTC instruments.
- The current system involves pulling in Bloomberg data and building software to generate transactions like corporate actions and cash flows, which can lead to discrepancies and reconciliation issues.
- The sell side may not want to publish their cash flow models for OTC instruments, as it reveals pricing information.The current system will be used until there is a feasible solution.

# Chat GPT DBT 


explain how dbt creates incremental model 

DBT (Data Build Tool) creates incremental models by taking advantage of the concept of materialization. Materialization is the process by which DBT generates and stores the results of a SQL query as a table in the target data warehouse.

When you define a DBT model, you can specify the materialization method to use. One of the available materialization methods is incremental, which tells DBT to generate a table that only contains the new or updated data since the last time the model was run. This method can be used for tables that only require updating with new data on a regular basis.

To create an incremental model, you need to define a SQL query that identifies the new or updated data. This query typically involves comparing the data in the source table with the data in the target table, using a date or timestamp column to identify new or updated rows. The SQL query should return only the new or updated rows, which DBT will use to populate the incremental model.

When you run an incremental model, DBT will compare the data in the source table with the data in the target table and use the SQL query to generate a new table containing only the new or updated data. This table is then stored as the target table for the next run of the incremental model. By using this approach, DBT can create incremental models that only contain the new or updated data, making them much faster to run than models that generate the entire table from scratch every time.




Andy Shar
show a small example with sql code
Sure, here's a simple example of creating an incremental model in DBT using SQL code:

Let's say you have a source table orders that contains information about customer orders, including an order_date column. You want to create an incremental model that only contains the new orders since the last time the model was run.

Your incremental model definition in DBT might look something like this:

```sql
Copy code
-- Define the incremental model
{{
    config(
        materialized='incremental'
    )
}}

-- Query to populate the incremental model
select * from orders
where order_date > (select max(order_date) from {{ this }})

```

This code defines an incremental model using the config() function and specifies the incremental materialization method. The SQL query then selects all the orders with an order_date greater than the maximum order_date in the existing target table (which is referenced using the {{ this }} syntax).

When you run this model, DBT will automatically generate and execute the SQL query, and create a new table containing only the new or updated rows since the last time the model was run. This new table will be stored as the target table for the next run of the incremental model.

Note that in order to use an incremental model, you need to have some way of identifying the new or updated data in the source table, such as a date or timestamp column. You also need to make sure that the target table has the same schema as the source table, so that the new data can be properly inserted into the target table.

Can we compare a key to do upsert in dbt model , show me sql code
Yes, you can use a key to perform an upsert (insert or update) in a DBT model. Here's an example of how to do this using SQL code:

Let's say you have a source table orders that contains information about customer orders, and you want to create a target table orders_target that is updated with new orders or modified orders. You can use the merge statement to perform an upsert based on a key.

Your DBT model definition might look something like this:

``sql
Copy code
-- Define the target table
{{
    config(
        materialized='table',
        table_name='orders_target'
    )
}}

-- Upsert query
merge into {{ this }} t
using orders s
on t.order_id = s.order_id
when matched then update
    set t.customer_id = s.customer_id,
        t.order_date = s.order_date,
        t.total_amount = s.total_amount
when not matched then insert (order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount)
    values (s.order_id, s.customer_id, s.order_date, s.total_amount)
This code defines a target table orders_target using the table materialization method, and then uses a merge statement to upsert data from the source table orders into the target table. The on clause in the merge statement specifies the key to use for the upsert, which in this case is the order_id column.
```
When you run this model, DBT will automatically generate and execute the merge statement, which will update existing rows in the target table if they exist in the source table, or insert new rows if they don't. The upsert is based on the order_id column, which acts as a key to match rows between the source and target tables.

Note that the merge statement is a powerful tool for upserts, but it can also be complex and resource-intensive. You should make sure to test your upsert queries carefully and consider the performance implications before using them in production.




Andy Shar
Create a custon dbt macro materialization to perfrom upsert based on primary key 
Sure, here's an example of how to create a custom DBT macro materialization to perform an upsert based on a primary key:

First, create a new file in your macros directory (e.g. upsert_by_pk.sql) and define your macro:

```sql
Copy code
{% macro upsert_by_pk(target_schema, target_table, source_table, pk_columns) %}
    {# Use the snowflake driver-specific syntax for handling null values #}
    {% set null_value = adapter.lower('null') %}

    {# Generate a comma-separated list of the primary key columns #}
    {% set pk = pk_columns|join(', ') %}

    {# Generate a comma-separated list of the non-primary key columns #}
    {% set non_pk = source_table.columns|selectattr('name', 'not in', pk_columns)|map(attribute='name')|join(', ') %}

    {# Build the upsert query #}
    {% set query = 
    "merge into {{target_schema}}.{{target_table}} t
    using {{ source_table.schema }}.{{ source_table.name }} s
    on {{ pk|format(source_table) }}
    when matched then update set
        {% for column in non_pk.split(', ') %}
            t.{{ column }} = s.{{ column }},
        {% endfor %}
        t.updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
    when not matched then insert (
        {% for column in source_table.columns %}
            {{ column.name }},
        {% endfor %}
        created_at, updated_at
    ) values (
        {% for column in source_table.columns %}
            coalesce(s.{{ column.name }}, {{ null_value }}),
        {% endfor %}
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
    );" %}

    {# Return the upsert query #}
    {{ return(query) }}
{% endmacro %}

```
This macro takes four arguments:

target_schema: The name of the schema where the target table is located
target_table: The name of the target table
source_table: The source table to upsert from
pk_columns: A list of primary key column names
The macro then generates a merge statement that performs an upsert based on the specified primary key columns. It uses the Snowflake driver-specific syntax for handling null values, and sets the created_at and updated_at columns to the current timestamp for new rows.

To use this macro in a DBT model, you can define a custom materialization that calls the macro:

```yaml
Copy code
version: 2

models:
  - name: my_upsert_model
    materialized: upsert_by_pk
    schema: my_schema
    table: my_table
    source_table: source_table
    primary_key_columns:
      - column1
      - column2
      
```
This model definition specifies the custom upsert_by_pk materialization, and passes in the required arguments for the macro. Note that the primary_key_columns argument is a list of primary key column names.

When you run this model, DBT will generate and execute the upsert query using the specified primary key columns to match rows between the source and target tables. This can be a powerful way to keep your target table up-to-date with new or modified data from your source table.

act as data engineer create anonymization macro in dbt for strings values 
Sure, here's an example of how to create an anonymization macro in DBT for string values:

```sql
Copy code
{% macro anonymize_string(column_name) %}
  case
    when {{ column_name }} is null then null
    else left(md5({{ column_name }}), 5)
  end
{% endmacro %}

```
This macro takes a single argument, column_name, which should be the name of the column to be anonymized. It uses the md5 function to generate a hash of the input string, and then takes the first five characters of the hash as the anonymized value. If the input string is null, the macro returns null.

To use this macro in a DBT model, you can call it in a select statement that selects the anonymized column and any other columns you need:

sql
Copy code
select
  {{ anonymize_string('email') }} as anonymized_email,
  name,
  address,
  phone_number
from my_table
In this example, the anonymize_string macro is called on the email column, and the resulting anonymized value is aliased as anonymized_email. The name, address, and phone_number columns are also selected.

When you run this DBT model, the anonymize_string macro will be used to generate anonymized values for the email column, while preserving the other columns. This can be a useful technique for anonymizing sensitive data while retaining some level of usability. Note that this macro is just one possible way to anonymize string values, and you should carefully consider your specific use case and data privacy requirements when implementing an anonymization strategy.

can update macro to have random value for each alphabet 
Sure, here's an updated version of the macro that generates a random value for each character in the input string:

```sql
Copy code
{% macro anonymize_string(column_name) %}
  case
    when {{ column_name }} is null then null
    else (
      select string_agg(
        chr((random() * 26 + 65)::int),
        ''
      )
      from generate_series(1, length({{ column_name }}))
    )
  end
{% endmacro %}

```
This macro still takes a single argument, column_name, which should be the name of the column to be anonymized. However, it uses a subquery to generate a random character for each character in the input string, and concatenates the characters into a new string.

The subquery uses the generate_series function to generate a series of integers from 1 to the length of the input string. For each integer in the series, the subquery selects a random number between 65 and 90 (which correspond to the ASCII codes for the uppercase letters A to Z) and converts it to a character using the chr function. The string_agg function then concatenates the characters into a new string.

If the input string is null, the macro returns null.

To use this macro in a DBT model, you can call it in a select statement as before:

sql
Copy code
select
  {{ anonymize_string('email') }} as anonymized_email,
  name,
  address,
  phone_number
from my_table
In this example, the anonymize_string macro is called on the email column, and the resulting anonymized value is aliased as anonymized_email. The name, address, and phone_number columns are also selected.

When you run this DBT model, the anonymize_string macro will be used to generate a random string of the same length as the input string, while preserving the other columns. This can be a useful technique for anonymizing sensitive data while retaining some level of usability. Note that this macro is just one possible way to anonymize string values, and you should carefully consider your specific use case and data privacy requirements when implementing an anonymization strategy.

Explai below dbt macro as 5 year old :
```
{% macro anonymize_string(column_name) %}
  case
    when {{ column_name }} is null then null
    else (
      select string_agg(characters.value, '' order by charindex)
      from unnest(regexp_split_to_array({{ column_name }}, '')) with ordinality as letters(letter, charindex)
      left join (
        select distinct letter, chr(97 + floor(random() * 26)::int) as value
        from unnest(generate_series(1, 26)) with ordinality as letters(idx, letter)
      ) as characters on letters.letter = characters.letter
    )
  end
{% endmacro %}

```
This is a computer program that can help you make secret words from other words. The program looks at each letter in the word you want to make a secret, and changes it to a different letter. It does this by using a special trick where it chooses a random letter for each letter in the word.

The program is like a special machine that takes in a word you want to make a secret, and then does a few things to it. First, it checks if the word is empty. If the word is empty, the machine won't do anything and will say that the secret is also empty.

If the word is not empty, the machine will look at each letter in the word one by one. It will then replace each letter with a different random letter. The machine uses a special trick to make sure that each letter is replaced with a different letter every time.

When the machine has replaced each letter with a new random letter, it puts all the new letters together to make a new secret word. The new secret word will have the same number of letters as the original word, but the letters will be different. This makes it hard for other people to guess the original word.

This program is useful if you want to keep things secret, like a password or a name. You can use this program to make a secret version of your name, so that other people won't be able to guess it.

covert above code to sql 
Sure, here's an example of how to implement the anonymize_string macro in SQL:

```sql
Copy code
{% macro anonymize_string(column_name) %}
  case
    when {{ column_name }} is null then null
    else (
      select string_agg(characters.value, '' order by charindex)
      from unnest(regexp_split_to_array({{ column_name }}, '')) with ordinality as letters(letter, charindex)
      left join (
        select distinct letter, chr(97 + floor(random() * 26)::int) as value
        from unnest(generate_series(1, 26)) with ordinality as letters(idx, letter)
      ) as characters on letters.letter = characters.letter
    )
  end
{% endmacro %}
```
This macro uses several SQL functions to generate an anonymized version of a string. Here's a breakdown of the code:

when {{ column_name }} is null then null checks if the input column is null, and returns null if it is.
else ( starts the else block that handles non-null inputs.
select string_agg(characters.value, '' order by charindex) concatenates the output values of the subquery into a string.
from unnest(regexp_split_to_array({{ column_name }}, '')) with ordinality as letters(letter, charindex) splits the input string into individual characters using the regexp_split_to_array function, and adds an ordinality column to preserve the order of the characters.
left join ( starts the subquery that generates the random values for each character.
select distinct letter, chr(97 + floor(random() * 26)::int) as value generates a random letter for each distinct letter in the input string.
from unnest(generate_series(1, 26)) with ordinality as letters(idx, letter) generates a series of numbers from 1 to 26, and uses the chr function to convert each number to a corresponding uppercase letter (A to Z). The ordinality column is used to match each random letter with the corresponding letter from the input string.
) as characters on letters.letter = characters.letter joins the subquery with the letters table on the letter column, so that each input character is replaced with a random character.
end closes the case block.
To use this macro in a DBT model, you can call it in a select statement as follows:

```sql
Copy code
select
  {{ anonymize_string('email') }} as anonymized_email,
  name,
  address,
  phone_number
from my_table

```
This query will anonymize the email column using the anonymize_string macro, while preserving the other columns.

what actual sql above dbt model select will generate in snowflake for 
The SQL generated by the DBT model using the anonymize_string macro will depend on the database that you're using. Since you mentioned Snowflake, here's an example of what the SQL might look like when using Snowflake as the database:

Assuming that you have a table called my_table with columns email, name, address, and phone_number, and you want to anonymize the email column using the anonymize_string macro, the resulting SQL might look like this:

```sql
Copy code
select
  case
    when email is null then null
    else (
      select string_agg(characters.value, '' order by charindex)
      from unnest(regexp_split_to_array(email, '')) with ordinality as letters(letter, charindex)
      left join (
        select distinct letter, chr(97 + floor(random() * 26)::int) as value
        from unnest(generate_series(1, 26)) with ordinality as letters(idx, letter)
      ) as characters on letters.letter = characters.letter
    )
  end as anonymized_email,
  name,
  address,
  phone_number
from my_table
```
This SQL code is the result of the DBT model that calls the anonymize_string macro. It will generate a new column called anonymized_email that contains the anonymized version of the email column using the anonymize_string macro. The other columns (name, address, and phone_number) are preserved as-is.

The SQL code generated by DBT will vary depending on the specifics of your DBT model, but it will always be based on the DBT macro and model definitions that you've provided.

explain string_agg function in snowflake 
string_agg is a function in Snowflake that concatenates values from a set of rows into a single string, with an optional separator string between each value.

The basic syntax of the string_agg function is:

sql
Copy code
string_agg(expression, separator)
where:

expression is the SQL expression that you want to concatenate. It can be any scalar expression, such as a column name or a function call.
separator is an optional string that is used to separate the concatenated values. If you omit this parameter, the default separator is a comma.
Here's an example of how you might use the string_agg function to concatenate the values from a column called my_column in a table called my_table:

sql
Copy code
select string_agg(my_column, ', ') as concatenated_values
from my_table
This SQL code will concatenate the values from the my_column column in my_table, separated by a comma and a space. The resulting string will be returned in a new column called concatenated_values.

Note that the string_agg function is only available in Snowflake starting from version 4.2. If you're using an older version of Snowflake, you can use the listagg function instead, which has similar functionality.
